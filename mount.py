### MOUNT PARTITIONS ##########################################################################################
#DESCRIPTION: This module mounts a partition
#INPUT: Filesystem, offset, absolute path to image, logfile location ("NONE" if logging is not required), and mount_point location
#OUTPUT: Returns success code (0 = mounted successfully, 1 = couldn't mount)
